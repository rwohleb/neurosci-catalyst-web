### Process ###

Members of the JSC are subject matter experts and have extensive experience in drug discovery and development in industrial and academic settings, basic and translational research in mood disorders, Alzheimer’s and neurodegenerative disease, as well as extensive experience in biotechnology company creation and investment.

* The top research teams at this stage will then be selected and invited to submit a full in-depth proposal.  These teams will receive important advice and additional expertise required in crafting the full research proposal
* Applicants will submit full research proposals which will be sent for external peer review
* Top-ranked successful research proposals will be funded according to a budget developed in collaboration with the JSC.
