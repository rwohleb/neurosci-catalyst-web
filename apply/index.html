### Application and Review Process ###

{% endmarkdown %}

    <ul>
      <li>Submitted LOIs by Applicants will undergo review by a Joint Steering Committee (JSC) composed of representatives from the University of Toronto, Janssen Inc. and Johnson & Johnson Innovation.   Members of the JSC are subject matter experts and have extensive experience in drug discovery and development in industrial and academic settings, basic and translational research in mood disorders, Alzheimer’s and neurodegenerative disease, as well as extensive experience in biotechnology company creation and investment.</li>
      <li>Selected Applicants will be invited to meet with the Joint Steering Committee for a face-to-face presentation.</li>
      <li>The top research teams at this stage (“Finalists”) will then be selected and invited to submit a full-length proposal. These teams will receive important advice and additional expertise required in crafting the full research proposal.</li>
      <li>Full research proposals submitted by finalists will be sent for external peer advisory review. (Note that applicants will have an opportunity to recommend external peer reviewers at this stage)</li>
      <li>Top-ranked successful research proposals will be funded according to a budget developed in collaboration with the JSC.</li>
    </ul>

      <ol>
         <li>Disruptive nature of project (novelty, impact, achievability).</li>
        <li>Collaborative approach to innovation and ability to inject novel thinking & science. (Does the proposal consider the science beyond the applicant’s laboratory?) <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/docs/Discovery_Sciences.pdf">Click here</a> for resources that could be made available to research programs.</li>
        <li>Attentiveness to healthcare with a direct impact to patient outcomes.</li>
      </ol>

#### Examples of Proposal Type and Funding Level/Duration of Funding ####

{% endmarkdown %}

      <ol>
 <li>Example 1 - a project funded for $78,900 for 9 months for in vitro (cell) target validation studies. Janssen could provide scientific guidance and expertise.</li>
        <li>Example 2 - a project funded for $234,500 for one year to develop a biomarker that could be translated into clinical use. Janssen could provide scientific guidance and expertise, and potentially patient samples to facilitate validation. </li>
        <li>Example 3 - a project funded for $345,600k for 24 months to optimize a cell assay for HTS screening, screen a small molecule library and validate hits in cell and potentially animal models. Janssen could provide in kind resources to enable the conduct of the HTS screen.</li>
      </ol>
