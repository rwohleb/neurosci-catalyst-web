The Neuroscience Catalyst program is focused on the overarching aim of accelerating the progress of new treatments for mood disorders and Alzheimer’s to the clinic. As such, we are interested in new drug targets, new models, biomarkers, platforms, compounds or technologies that have potential for novel interventions in these disorders.

Here are examples of some areas of particular interest:
