The Neuroscience Catalyst program is focused on the overarching aim of accelerating the progress of new treatments for mood disorders and Alzheimer’s to the clinic. As such, we are interested in new drug targets, new models, biomarkers, platforms, compounds or technologies that have potential for novel interventions in these disorders.

Here are examples of some areas of particular interest:

{% endmarkdown %}

    <div class="callout callout-info interest">
      Investigation of the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD e.g. TREM2, CD33 etc) to identify novel treatments or drug targets.
    </div>
    <div class="callout callout-info interest">
      Novel approaches to the treatment of AD and related dementias, other than those that directly impact on amyloid formation, deposition and disposition. 
    </div>
    <div class="callout callout-info interest">
      Exploration of the commercial utility of novel tools, technologies, or devices in the Neurosciences, especially those with the potential to provide disruptive healthcare solutions for patients affected by AD or Mood disorders. To include biomarkers of brain structure and function that may help delineate disease types and clinical trial decision making.
    </div>
    <div class="callout callout-info interest">
      The role of epigenetics in the etiology and treatment of AD &/or mood disorders (e.g. protein methyltransferases). 
    </div>
    <div class="callout callout-info interest">
      Role of neuroinflammation in the etiology and treatment of mood disorders. 
    </div>
