Neuroscience Catalyst is an innovative collaboration between industry, academia and the broader research community to fund open-source, pre-competitive, early-stage investigations that can progress to clinical treatments for mood disorders and Alzheimer’s disease. Neuroscience Catalyst represents a commitment from the collaborators, Janssen Inc., The Johnson & Johnson Innovation Center (JJIC) in California and the University of Toronto’s Centre for Collaborative Drug Research (CCDR), to address unmet medical needs in the areas of mood disorders and Alzheimer’s disease that affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

Participating researchers will have access to cutting-edge drug discovery tools and information, as well as access to the Johnson & Johnson Innovation center compound product library, thereby facilitating research progress. The University of Toronto will co-fund the research and create a structure for soliciting and evaluating research proposals from researchers across Canada, including other academic hospitals and research institutions, as well as Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).

An interdisciplinary team of scientists from the University of Toronto, Janssen, government and other external organizations will form a Scientific Oversight Board to identify strategic priority areas and review research proposals in order to determine eligibility for funding relevant to research targets.  This oversight board also will provide scientific oversight and advice on funded research and will monitor the progress of and review results arising from this research.
